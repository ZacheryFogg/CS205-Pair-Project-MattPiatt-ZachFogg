Repository for CS 205 Pair Project(Matt Piatt and Zach Fogg) 

This repository's purpose is to model a university.

For our data we decided to model a university, specifically UVM. There will be five entities in our model; A University, Colleges within that university, Professors that teach within those colleges, and Courses that those professors teach, and subsections of those Courses. A rough draft of these various entities is below, some fields may be dropped or added:
